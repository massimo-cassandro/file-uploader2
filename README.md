Fileuploader automates and simplifies uploading files to HTML pages.

Uploads are performed asynchronously via an Ajax call to a server-side script that must register the file and return a JSON string.

Although the default settings are based on Bootstrap 4, FileUploader is entirely and easily configurable from scratch and can be adapted to any layout.

The [demo](https://massimo-cassandro.github.io/js-file-uploader/demo/) folder contains many examples of FileUploader using.

Take a look at [wiki pages](https://massimo-cassandro.github.io/js-file-uploader/wiki) for detailed usage and configuration instructions.
