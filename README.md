Fileuploader automates and simplifies uploading files to HTML pages.

Uploads are performed asynchronously via an Ajax call to a server-side script that must register the file and return a JSON string.

Although the default settings are based on Bootstrap 4, FileUploader is entirely and easily configurable from scratch and can be adapted to any layout.

The [demo](https://github.com/massimo-cassandro/js-file-uploader/demo/) folder contains many examples of FileUploader using.

Take a look at [wiki pages](https://github.com/massimo-cassandro/js-file-uploader/wiki) for detailed usage and configuration instructions.

Works with all modern browser (tested thanks to [Browserstack Open Source program](https://www.browserstack.com/open-source)).

## Installation

FileUploader can be installed using npm:

```
